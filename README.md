# Visual Workflow Wrapper
A Salesforce Lightning component used to wrap visual workflows. Though a standard visual workflow can be added to Lightning pages or Community pages, there are currently some shortcomings. This component can be used to expose visual workflows to guest users in Communities, as well as setting return locations for a visual workflow once it has finished.
